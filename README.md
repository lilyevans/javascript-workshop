Starting a Modern Front-end App from Scratch: A Workshop
======================

**Audience**: Developers who want to know how modern technologies and tools fit together
            to create a front-end app<br/>
**Length**: 3.5 hours?<br/>
**Pre-requisites**:
- Basic familiarity with JavaScript and HTML
- Comfortable with basic command line

## Narrative
We will get hands-on experience in starting a modern front-end application from scratch.
Though we use a very simple React application as a playground, the focus is on the toolchain
and the need for the different technologies involved. Every time we introduce a new technology,
we will try to understand what problem it is solving first.

At the end, attendees will be able to answer some of the following questions:
- "Why are the latest JavaScript libraries structured the way they are?"
- "What is the first step in starting a new JavaScript project?"
- "What is Babel and why do we need it?"

Attendees will leave with the experience of doing it themselves, a reference-able
example project that they can refer to or continue working on, and resources for
further researching.
