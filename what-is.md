## What is ES6?
JavaScript is a continually evolving programming language standardized over time by a committee of browser vendors, developers, and community members. In the past two years, this committee has introduced ES6, the largest update in the history of JavaScript, and ES7, the first of more frequent annual releases. Together the two versions add hundreds of new features to help developers write expressive, concise, and fast applications.

## What is Babel?
Babel is a JavaScript compiler. It has 3 stages (as do most compilers), 1) parse 2) transform and 3) generate. Out of the box, Babel would do a no-op on all files given to it. Transformations are added to Babel as plugins, which it calls presets. For example, given a preset of "es2015", Babel would be able to transform (compile) any ES2015 code into standard JavaScript that could be interpreted in the browser.
