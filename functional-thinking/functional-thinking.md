Functional thinking and programming.
Immutability.
Data in data out.
Isolation of side effects.

This happens in every language, is that we tend to focus a lot on what library we are using and keep using the language in the same way that we might use other languages. While you can be fairly productive treating JavaScript like Java or some other OO language, you will be missing out on core features that will make you more productive, and are pretty necessary to modern applications.

For JavaScript, we get into functional programming and thinking, which is what libraries such as React are built on.

Functional programming is actually a big topic, and JavaScript is not a 100% functional language like something like Haskall or Clojure, but the principles are there.

So, today, the important thing I want to dive into a little bit is treating functions as a first class citizen.
