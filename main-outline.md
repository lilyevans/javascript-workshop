Testing
Including other things in your bundle?
Styling?
Extra Credit: souce maps, eslint, etc...


## High level agenda:

- History of JS, how did we get here?
- Functional thinking in JavaScript
- From nothing to working app


## From nothing to working app:
Possible apps:
- Tweet box
- Mars Rover
- some kind of shopping thing
- quiz


- one HTML file. Include React manually. Render hello world. Open file in web browser.
- Break out js file
- Start on tweet box
- Es6 + babel
- Eslint?
- List of tweets component
- Webpack
- Too many characters
- Submit tweet and show in list
- Testing?
- Chrome extension
- Source maps
- styling? inline styles?

TweetBox features
- Post a tweet
- Show list of tweets
- show character count
- disable submit button when character count is not right
- style character count when it goes < 0


Tech to include:
- node & npm
- ES6 + Babel
- webpack
- React
- mocha?
- CSS/Sass?



Other possible discussions:
- History of JS, why React?
- Functional programming and thinking
- JavaScript ecosystem
- ES6 (maybe this is with JS ecosystem)
- CSS basics
