  1. Intro to webpack and bundling
    - webpack is a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications.
    - so, what is a "JS module", will get to that. Lets go ahead and install and configure webpack 1st.

  2. Jump to command-line.md
  3. Set up webpack
  4. Add import and export statements to index.js and TweetBox.js
  5. Change index.html to use new app bundle
  6. Extract postTweet as a new module, import into index.js, and pass as prop to TweetBox
    - Notice that the webpack has rebuilt the bundle here
  7. Review
  8. git commit

<!--
  Next: Big missing piece is that we are just opening the app up as a static file. Wouldn't be able to
  do any routing with this setup for example.
