<!--
  1. Add character count feature. Must convert TweetBox to an ES6 class.
  2. Review
  3. git commit

  Next:

  So far this architecture has been working just fine, we are using ES6 and JSX which is cool.
  Our code runs efficiently.

  But there are some major deficiencies and an app structured like this just won't scale.
  1) It will become a hassle to add a <script> tag for every component we create and every library we need. Also this is not good for
    performance in an HTTP 1.1 world
  2) Not managing versions of runtime libraries and depend on external CDNs
  3) Everything is a global! No declared dependencies of JS files. Rely on presence of global variables.

  We need to introduce modularity and explicit dependency management into our app.
  We need to take it from just being an assortment of JS files to an actual application.

  To do that: webpack.
