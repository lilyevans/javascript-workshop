  0. Explain how serving static assets will work

  1. `npm install express --save-dev`
  2. Give attendees the server.js
  3. Change the path for the application bundle in index.html
  5. `node server.js`
  6. `npm run build:watch`
  7. open http://localhost:8080
  8. Change "main" in package.json to server.js and `npm start`
    - Make a change and then refresh to show it take effect

  ** git commit here **

  9. `npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev`

    This binds a small express server on localhost:8080 which serves your static assets as well
    as the bundle (compiled automatically). It automatically updates the browser page when a
    bundle is recompiled (SockJS). Open http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/bundle in your browser.

    The dev server uses webpackâ€™s watch mode. It also prevents webpack from emitting the
    resulting files to disk. Instead it keeps and serves the resulting files from memory.

  10. `./node_modules/.bin/webpack-dev-server --progress --colors`
  11. open http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/ (Don't forget the final /, its important)
  12. Add a script for that in package.json.
  13. Make a change to a component to show the hot reloading

  14. Review
  15. git commit
